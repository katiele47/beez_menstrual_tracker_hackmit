<h1><b>welcome to our mithack app, we won first place in Intersystems healthcare track </h1></b> <br />

Beez aims to bridge the gender data gap in healthcare. The app allows women to track and predict all reproductive phases using a trained machine learning model. By allowing users to opt-in to share their data with researchers - Beez hopes to facilitate research in women's health. No similar application exists today and we genuinely believe the healthcare world needs Beez. <br/>

We’ve also uploaded “last period date” to the Intersystems Cloud. If we can connect this to health care practitioners, it will be especially useful in emergencies because some medicines -like painkillers - have different efficacies in different phases of a women’s cycle. Doctors can then determine the amount and type of medication to be administered. <br/>
